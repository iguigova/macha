Cover Letter Style Guide – Ilka Guigova

Purpose
Cover letters should sound like a senior engineer explaining fit clearly and professionally, not selling enthusiasm or narrating motivation.

Length
- One page maximum
- Concise; do not pad to fill space

Structure (default)
1. Opening: role + factual fit
2. Why I’m a strong fit: concrete experience and scope
3. Technical alignment: direct mapping to role requirements
4. What I bring: how I work in practice
5. Closing + “Thank you for your time and consideration.”

Tone
- Direct
- Concrete
- Lightly personal
- Calm and confident
- Senior, credible voice

Framing
- Light framing is acceptable (impact, scope, ownership)
- Avoid aspirational or emotional language
- Avoid “I’m excited,” “I’m passionate,” “I enjoy challenges”

Avoid
- Mission-driven language
- Abstract evaluation of problem spaces
- Corporate enthusiasm or hype
- Meta commentary about the application itself

Default assumption
If not otherwise specified, this style and structure should be used.

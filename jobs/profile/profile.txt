# Career

At Flourish Software (May 2024–Jan 2026), I was a Senior Full-Stack Engineer on a regulatory compliance platform serving 1,000+ licensed facilities across multiple US states. The stack was Node.js/TypeScript backend, Angular/TypeScript frontend, 14 microservices. I prefer framing this as "regulatory compliance platform" rather than "cannabis." I did NOT own deployment orchestration at Flourish — do not claim this.

At Flourish, I led 8 major feature initiatives including multi-state METRC and Biotrack compliance integrations, enterprise platform modernization, manufacturing workflows, and compliance audit frameworks.

At Flourish, I built the Zapier integration layer end-to-end from scratch, exposing the platform API to customers. I also integrated Bartender Cloud API using OAuth2 for automated label printing.

At Flourish, I built a Data Fix CLI tool with 50+ commands for production data corrections, a PDF processing engine for regulatory compliance, and service orchestration across 15+ services.

At Willow Inc (2021–2024), I integrated insights, tickets, inspections, notifications, and reports on digitized environments with Asset Digital Twin (ADT) models using GraphQL. Clients included Walmart, DFW Airport, Northern Arizona University, and BNP Paribas. I enacted QA standards in CI/CD infrastructure. Willow won "AI Startup of the Year" from AI Breakthrough Awards.

At Bread & Butter IO (2019–2021), I built the OAuth/OIDC/SAML authentication infrastructure from scratch, integrating 35+ identity providers (Google, Microsoft, Apple, social platforms, enterprise SSO). I built comprehensive unit and user acceptance test suites enabling rapid deployments and easy onboarding of new providers. OWASP security practices.

At DeliverySlip (2011–2019), I designed a dynamic rules engine and an indexed caching layer from scratch for a secure email messaging system with large file sharing, electronic signatures, and non-repudiable audit trails. I improved maintainability by 80%. I supervised QA and testing teams for 8 years.

At PointyHat (2010–2011), I designed an unlimited undo/redo solution for an online theater script editor. I delivered it in 2 weeks. It was later repurposed as the auto-recovery mechanism.

At Klein Systems Group (2008–2010), I built a self-learning mapping engine for marine traffic from scratch, processing 300+ calls per second. I also worked on configurable data import and validation across multiple message formats.

At Vivonet (2007–2008), I refactored a payment processing system handling millions of transactions per month. I reduced complexity by 40%, cut QA turnaround by 33%, and improved early error detection by 5x through moderated software inspections. The system achieved PA-DSS certification.

Earlier (2000–2007): I implemented floor operations for automotive assembly plants (SmartCart). I led an ultrasound localization feasibility study using RANSAC algorithms. I worked on a robot simulation system as a Canadian Space Agency sub-contract. I researched mobile web technologies and built VRML models for peer-to-peer 3D design collaboration.

# Education

I have a B.Sc. Mathematics (Honors Specialist) from the University of Toronto (2002), ranked 6th in class. I took most Computer Science courses including Computational Complexity.
I have a Software Specialist diploma from the College of Electronic Systems in Sofia, Bulgaria (1996), with Top 3 Student Distinction.
I have a Business Informatics Certificate from the University of Economics in Sofia (1997).
I completed Stanford Online courses in Machine Learning, AI, and Databases (2011).
I completed MIT OCW Dynamic Programming & Stochastic Control (2010).
I hold a Microsoft Certification Exam 70-536 (2008) and a Project Management Certificate from Centennial College (2007).
I speak French (Level 12, Institut Français) and German (Level 4, Goethe Institut).

# Accomplishments

I published the FIFF file comparison algorithm — it runs as fast as LCS but handles non-sequential differences. It was used by the Code Project "Lean and Mean" winner.
I published an elegant poker hand evaluation solution that avoids sorting and lookups, working for both 5-card and 7-card games.
I mentored high school students through the Microsoft TEALS program, building sustainable CS curricula.

# Personal

My philosophy is: "Identify multiple solutions, choose the simplest that meets the need."
I value integrity, enthusiasm, and constant learning.
I am motivated by challenges that require creativity and discipline.
In high school, I solved an assembler problem my professor declared "unsolvable."
My favorite technical reading is Roy Fielding's dissertation on Architectural Styles.
I describe myself as: "A kernel of laughter. I find freedom in the second law of thermodynamics."
My interests include climbing, scrambling, hiking, swimming, kayaking, skiing, and dancing.
I hold motorcycle and wilderness first aid certifications.

# Cover Letter Style

Cover letters should sound like a senior engineer explaining fit clearly and professionally.
Direct, factual, no fluff. Concrete. Lightly personal. Calm, confident, senior credible voice.
Never say "excited," "passionate," or "20+ years."
Never use mission-driven language, abstract problem spaces, corporate enthusiasm, or meta commentary.
Light framing is acceptable (impact, scope, ownership).
Single page maximum. Concise — do not pad to fill space.
Structure: Opening (role + factual fit) → Why fit (concrete projects) → Technical alignment → What I bring (work style) → Close with "Thank you for your time and consideration."

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years building systems where correctness 
matters. Strong background in high-reliability, performance-critical systems 
across marine, automotive, hospitality, cannabis tech, IoT/building management, 
identity/security, and communications industries.

Self-described as "a kernel of laughter" - combines deep technical expertise 
with creativity and problem-solving enthusiasm.


================================================================================
EXPERIENCE QUANTIFICATION (for application forms)
================================================================================

Use these estimates when filling out application questions:

STRONG AREAS (can claim with confidence):
• REST API design & development:              ~15 years
• Authentication/authorization systems:       ~15 years (OAuth, OIDC, SAML expertise)
• Relational databases (PostgreSQL, etc.):    ~10+ years (schema design, query optimization)
• Docker in production:                       ~4-5 years
• Microservices architecture:                 ~5 years

GAPS (be honest about these):
• Python/Django/Flask/FastAPI:                No expert-level experience
                                              (Primary languages: Go, C#, Java, TypeScript)
• Celery/RQ/message queues:                   No direct experience
                                              (Has adjacent async patterns from high-throughput APIs)
• Elasticsearch:                              No experience listed
• Kafka/Airflow:                              No experience listed

NOTE: Has consistently ramped quickly on new stacks. Gaps are real but surmountable.


================================================================================
0→1 BACKEND SYSTEMS OWNERSHIP
================================================================================

Strong track record of building backend systems from scratch:

1. BREAD & BUTTER - OAuth Integration System (2019-2021)
   Built the authentication infrastructure from scratch, implementing OAuth 1.0, 
   2.0, OIDC, and SAML 2.0 protocols. Integrated 35+ identity providers (Google, 
   Microsoft, Apple, social platforms, enterprise SSO). This became the core 
   infrastructure powering the platform's social login and identity verification.

2. FLOURISH SOFTWARE - Zapier Integration (2024-2026)
   Owned the Zapier integration end-to-end. Designed the framework and built it 
   out to connect the regulatory compliance platform with the Zapier ecosystem.

3. KLEIN SYSTEMS GROUP - Self-Learning Mapping Engine (2008-2010)
   Built a mapping engine for marine traffic from scratch, processing 300+ 
   calls/second.

4. DELIVERYSLIP - Dynamic Rules Engine (2011-2019)
   Designed and built the rules engine from scratch, plus the indexed caching 
   layer that improved maintainability by 80%.

5. POINTYHAT - Unlimited Undo/Redo System (2010-2011)
   Designed and delivered a novel unlimited undo/redo solution in two weeks. 
   It worked well enough that it was later repurposed as the auto-recovery 
   mechanism.
